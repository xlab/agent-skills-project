## ⚡ Try It Now

No installation needed. Just run:

```bash
uvx add-skill kasperjunge/hello-world
```

**That's it.** The skill is now available in Claude Code.

---

## 📦 Install Any Resource

```bash
uvx add-skill <github-username>/<skill-name>       # Skills
uvx add-command <github-username>/<command-name>   # Slash commands
uvx add-agent <github-username>/<agent-name>       # Sub-agents
```

---

## 🛠 Create Your Own Toolkit

Build a personal collection of resources that travels with you.

### Quick Start

```bash
uvx create-agent-resources-repo
```

This creates a ready-to-use `agent-resources/` directory with example skill, command, and agent.

**With GitHub automation** (requires [gh CLI](https://cli.github.com/)):

```bash
uvx create-agent-resources-repo --github
```

Creates the repo, pushes to GitHub, and you're immediately shareable.

### Manual Setup

Or create the structure yourself — it's just a GitHub repo named **`agent-resources`**:

```
your-username/agent-resources/
└── .claude/
    ├── skills/
    │   └── my-skill/
    │       └── SKILL.md
    ├── commands/
    │   └── my-command.md
    └── agents/
        └── my-agent.md
```

### That's It

Your resources are now installable:

```bash
uvx add-skill your-username/my-skill
```

No publishing. No registry. Push to GitHub and it works.
